# Project Structure Overview

## `node_modules`

This folder contains all the code that your project depends on. When you install something using npm (Node Package Manager), it goes here. Imagine it as a big library where your project can borrow books (code) from.

## `src` Folder

This is where most of your project's code lives. It's the heart of your Angular project, containing all the source code for your application. Inside this folder:

### `app`

This directory is where you build your application components, services, and modules. It's like the workshop where you craft your app's functionality.

- `app.component.css`: Contains the styles specifically for the main component of your Angular app. It's like the outfit your main character wears in a story.
- `app.component.html`: Design the layout for your main component here. It's like the script for the scenes involving your main character.
- `app.component.spec.ts`: Holds tests for the main component. It's like the quality control department, ensuring your main component works as expected.
- `app.component.ts`: The main component file itself, where you write the logic and behavior for your main component. It's like the script for your main character's actions.
- `app.config.ts`: This file might hold configuration settings for your app. It's like the backstage crew, making sure everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.
- `app.routes.ts`: Defines the routes if your app uses routing (navigating between different pages). It's like the map guiding your users through your app's different sections.

### `assets`

This directory stores static files used by your application, like images, fonts, or icons. It's like a storage room for all the visual elements of your app.

- `favicon.ico`: The small icon that appears next to your website's name in a browser tab. It's like the emblem representing your app in the browser.

## `index.html`

The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your Angular application. It's like the front door to your app.

## `main.ts`

The main entry point for your Angular app. It's where the app is bootstrapped or initialized. It's like the conductor starting the orchestra before a performance.

## `styles.css`

Contains global styles that apply to your entire application. It's like the theme setting the overall aesthetic of your app.

## `.editorconfig`

Contains configuration settings for your code editor, like indentation style and file encoding. It's like the rulebook ensuring consistency among developers working on the project.

## `.gitignore`

Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It's like the filter preventing unnecessary files from being committed to your version control system.

## `package-lock.json`

Helps ensure that everyone working on your project installs the same versions of dependencies. It's like a detailed version history of everything in your "node_modules" library.

## `angular.json`

Used to configure Angular's build and development process. It's like a blueprint that tells Angular how to construct your app.

## `tsconfig` files

These files contain configuration settings for TypeScript, the language Angular is built with. They tell TypeScript how to compile your code.

## `.browserslistrc`

Used to define which browsers your project should support. It helps ensure your app works well across different browsers.

## `README.md`

Typically contains information about your project, like how to install and use it. It's like the welcome brochure for newcomers to your project.
